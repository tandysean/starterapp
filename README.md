# Starter for Node API and React Application

This starter app contains one git repo for both Client and Server applications.
I would suggest initializing git for each one independently if you clone this repo. 
Just a much more stripped down basic application scafolding that you can do what you want with.â—Š

start api with `npm run start` from root `api` folder <br/>
start webClient with `npm run start` from root `webApp`
